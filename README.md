# GuessNumberApp

A very simple app just to enhance my knowledge of data transfer from one screen to other screen
Complete styling without using any elements or pre-build elements

Just a fun game where you make computer guess the number you've entered in the main screen and also you see your score in the game over screen
when you make a guess all the input gets printed to the screen and you see a live presentation of data

No database added as I have created it just to understand data-flow structure and also how to make components
